    "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
    "    ->Interpreted languages execute code line by line using an interpreter, while compiled languages translate the entire program into machine code before execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "      Interpreted: Python, JavaScript — easier to debug, slower execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "      Compiled: C, C++ — faster execution, harder to debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is Exception Handling in Python?\n",
    "    ->Exception handling in Python allows the program to handle runtime errors gracefully without crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "    try: Code that might cause an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "    except: Handles the error if it occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "    else: Executes if no error occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "    finally: Always executes (used for cleanup).\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling.\n",
    "    ->The finally block in Python is used to define a section of code that will always be executed, regardless of whether an exception was raised or not in the try block. It is typically used for cleanup operations such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Closing open files\n",
    "\n",
    "    Releasing system or network resources\n",
    "\n",
    "    Disconnecting from a database\n",
    "\n",
    "    Even if the program encounters an error or a return statement in the try or except blocks, the code inside the finally block will still run.\n",

    "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
    "    ->In Python, multiple exceptions can be handled using either multiple except blocks or a single except block with a tuple of exception types.\n",
    "\n",
    "        When different types of errors may occur in a try block, you can use separate except blocks for each specific exception type. This allows different handling code for each error.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Alternatively, if the handling logic is the same for multiple exceptions, you can group them together using a tuple in a single except block.\n",
    "\n",
    "        This improves code readability and ensures the program can continue running smoothly even when multiple types of errors might occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
    "    ->The with statement in Python is used for automatic resource management, especially when working with files. Its main purpose is to ensure that a file is properly closed after its operations are completed, even if an error occurs during processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "     Key Benefits:\n",
    "    Automatically closes the file\n",
    "\n",
    "    Makes code cleaner and more readable\n",

    "\n",
    "        Threads share memory space\n",
    "\n",
    "        Best for I/O-bound tasks (e.g., file reading, network calls)\n",
    "\n",
    "        Affected by Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)\n",
    "\n",
    "        Faster for tasks involving waiting/input-output\n",
    "\n",
    "     Multiprocessing:\n",

    "\n",
    "         6. Better Than print()\n",
    "        Unlike print(), logs can be directed to multiple outputs (files, console, servers) and formatted for clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "         7. Configurable and Flexible\n",
    "        Logging can be easily customized in terms of formatting, log level, output destination, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "         Conclusion\n",
    "        Logging is essential for building reliable, maintainable, and scalable software. It provides a powerful way to trace and understand program execution, especially in large or long-running applications.\n",

    "11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
    "    ->Memory management in Python refers to the process of allocating, using, and freeing memory during the execution of a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "      Key Features of Python's Memory Management:\n",
    "        Automatic Memory Management\n",
    "        Python handles memory allocation and deallocation automatically through its built-in memory manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Reference Counting\n",
    "        Each object has a reference count. When the count drops to zero (i.e., no variable refers to the object), the memory is released.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Garbage Collection\n",
    "        Python uses a garbage collector to detect and clean up circular references—objects that reference each other but are no longer used.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Private Heap Space\n",
    "        All Python objects and data structures are stored in a private heap managed by the Python memory manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Memory Pools (PyMalloc)\n",
    "        Python uses an internal system called PyMalloc to manage small memory blocks efficiently.\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
    "    ->Python uses a structured approach to handle errors using the try, except, else, and finally blocks. These steps help you catch and manage runtime exceptions gracefully.\n",
    "     Ex:\n",
    "     try:\n",
    "    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "    except ValueError:\n",
    "        print(\"That's not a number!\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"You entered:\", num)\n",
    "    finally:\n",
    "        print(\"Execution complete.\")\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
    "    ->Memory management is crucial in Python to ensure that programs run efficiently, reliably, and without crashing due to memory issues.\n",
    "        Key Reasons:\n",
    "        Prevents Memory Leaks\n",
    "        Automatically freeing unused memory helps avoid memory being wasted on unused objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Improves Performance\n",
    "        Efficient memory usage ensures the program runs faster and consumes fewer system resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Ensures Stability\n",
    "        Proper memory management prevents issues like program freezes, crashes, or unexpected behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Supports Large-Scale Applications\n",
    "        In big applications with many objects and data, good memory handling keeps the program scalable.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Automatic Cleanup via Garbage Collection\n",
    "        Python’s garbage collector handles most cleanup, but understanding memory management helps avoid circular references or unnecessary memory use.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
    "    ->The try and except blocks are the core components of exception handling in Python. They help in managing errors gracefully without crashing the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "     Role of try:\n",
    "        Used to wrap code that might raise an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "        If no error occurs, the code runs normally.\n",
    "\n",
    "        If an error occurs, Python jumps to the except block.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        #try:\n",
    "        #result = 10 / 0\n",
    "        \n",
    "     Role of except:\n",
    "        Defines how to handle specific exceptions that occur in the try block.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Prevents the program from stopping unexpectedly.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        #except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "         #   print(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n",
    "         \n",
    "         \n",
    "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
    "    ->Python’s garbage collection system automatically frees memory by deleting objects that are no longer in use. This helps manage memory efficiently and prevents memory leaks.\n",
    "        Key Components:\n",
    "            1. Reference Counting\n",
    "            Every object in Python keeps track of how many references point to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "            When an object’s reference count drops to zero, it is immediately deleted.\n",
    "            \n",
    "            a = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "            b = a  # reference count = 2\n",
    "            del a  # reference count = 1\n",
    "            del b  # reference count = 0 → object deleted\n",
    "            \n",
    "            2. Garbage Collector (GC)\n",
    "                Python also has a cyclic garbage collector to detect and clean up circular references (objects referencing each other, but not used).\n",
    "                import gc\n",
    "                gc.collect()  # Manually triggers garbage collection\n",
    "                \n",
    "      Python constantly monitors objects and their reference counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "      If no references are left, the object is destroyed.\n",
    "\n",
    "      If circular references exist, the garbage collector identifies and clears them periodically.\n",
    "      \n",
    "\n",
    "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
    "    ->The else block in Python exception handling is used to define code that should run only if no exception occurs in the try block.\n",
    "\n",
    "         Purpose:\n",
    "        To separate normal code from error-handling code\n",
    "\n",
    "        Makes the program logic clearer and more organized\n",
    "\n",
    "        Runs only if the try block completes successfully\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
    "    -> Python’s logging module provides several built-in logging levels to indicate the severity or importance of a message.\n",
    "\n",

    "23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
    "    ->While Python automates memory management through reference counting and garbage collection, certain challenges still exist:\n",
    "\n",
    "         1. Circular References\n",
    "        Objects referencing each other (like in linked data structures) can prevent automatic deletion.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Python’s garbage collector handles this, but it may delay cleanup.\n",
    "\n",
    "         2. Memory Leaks\n",
    "        Can occur when references to unused objects are accidentally kept alive.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Common in large applications or when using global variables carelessly.\n",
    "\n",
    "         3. High Memory Consumption\n",
    "        Python objects consume more memory compared to low-level languages like C.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Structures like lists and dictionaries are memory-heavy.\n",
    "\n",
    "         4. Inefficient Use of Resources\n",
    "        Keeping large objects in memory longer than needed affects performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Developers must manually optimize memory usage in such cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "         5. Manual Garbage Collection (in Some Cases)\n",
    "        The garbage collector may not always collect circular references immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Developers may need to use gc.collect() manually to force collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "         6. Third-Party Extensions\n",
    "        Some C/C++ extensions or poorly written libraries may not follow Python's memory rules, leading to leaks or crashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
    "    ->You can raise an exception manually using the raise keyword followed by an exception type.\n",
    "    #syntax\n",
    "    raise ExceptionType(\"Error message\")\n",
    "    Example:\n",
    "        age = -5\n",
    "        if age < 0:\n",
    "            raise ValueError(\"Age cannot be negative\")\n",
    "            \n",
    "    Custom exception example:\n",
    "            class MyError(Exception):\n",
    "                pass\n",
    "\n",
    "            raise MyError(\"This is a custom exception\")\n",

    "            \n",
    "25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
    "    ->Multithreading allows a program to run multiple threads concurrently within the same process. It is important in specific types of applications for better performance and responsiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "        # Key Reasons to Use Multithreading:\n",
    "        1.Improves Responsiveness\n",
    "\n",
    "            Keeps the program active while performing time-consuming tasks (e.g., downloading files while the UI remains responsive).\n",
    "\n",
    "        2.Efficient I/O Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "            Ideal for I/O-bound tasks like reading/writing files, handling user input, or network communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "        3.Faster Execution for Concurrent Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "            Allows multiple tasks to run seemingly at the same time (e.g., real-time data logging and processing).\n",
    "\n",
    "        4.Better Resource Utilization\n",
    "\n",
    "            Makes use of idle CPU time while waiting for I/O operations to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "        5.Enables Background Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "            Useful in running background tasks like auto-saving, file scanning, or notifications without interrupting the main program.\n",
